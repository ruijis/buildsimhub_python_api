"""
This sample file demonstrate how to upload a list of EnergyPlus models into one simulation job

Current issue the tracking will skip the first model, so user might see a  model missing in the tracking information.
e.g.
Upload 2 models and run them in parallel
But tracking info shows:
Total progress 0%, success: 0, failure: 0, running: 1, queue: 0

This is a known issue and we will working on a fix solution.
